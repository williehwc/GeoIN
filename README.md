GeoIN
=====

Add in geospatial information to your PDFs so you can use them with GeoPDF smartphone apps like [Avenza Maps](https://www.avenza.com/avenza-maps/), perfect for park, trail, and college campus maps! Just align the OpenStreetMap to the map in your PDF, save the geospatial PDF, and transfer it to your phone. The next time you visit the location, open the geospatial PDF on your phone and see your location as you move around.

This app requires [GDAL](https://gdal.org/en/stable/download.html) to be installed. GDAL is responsible for the actual PDF processing, while this app is a frontend that helps you get the coordinates represented in your map.
